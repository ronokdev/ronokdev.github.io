### Objective of this article
we are going to understand how to build and host portfolio site with jekyll-chirpy under 1 hour. We will use chirpy as a theme and we will host this static site to GitHub.


### Why we are using jekyll
Because jekyll is open-source static site generator and it also has a very good integration with GitHub Pages. If you already have a ruby development setup installed in your local machine then it is very easy and much fast to run anything with jekyll locally


### How to Prepare our local development environment to get started
In this article we will only discuss how to set up in the MAC environment

First , we need to check if we already have ruby installed
```bash
which -a ruby
```
if we see something like this as output 
```text
/usr/bin/ruby
```
that means we already have ruby installed in our machine.

As the system Ruby is old, and it canâ€™t be updated we will not use the ruby that is already installed , instead we will set up latest version of ruby and then work with it.


we can set up ruby in a lot of different ways but my recommendation is to use a ruby version manager tool like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Also with `rbenv` we can switch between multiple Ruby versions on the same machine if needed.
