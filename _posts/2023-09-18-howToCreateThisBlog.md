## Objective of this article
we are going to understand how to build and host portfolio site with jekyll-chirpy.
<br>

This is the first part of a 4 part series article and we will understand :

1. How to set up local Environment for Ruby 
2. How to use Chirpy theme and run it locally and deploy to GitHub pages
3. How to add a comment section for each post using `giscus`
4. How to add custom domain name to our portfolio website

We will use chirpy as a theme, and host this static site to GitHub. In the first part we will understand how to prepare our local environment to get started.


## Why we are using jekyll
jekyll is open-source static site generator, and it also has a very good integration with GitHub Pages. If you already have a ruby development setup installed in your local machine then it is very easy and fast to run anything with jekyll locally. And there is a ton of theme out there which are opensource and easy to get started.


## How to Prepare local development environment to get started
In this article we will only discuss how to set up in the **MAC environment**. Setup in Linux and windows is also very simple. 

First , we need to check if we already have ruby installed
```bash
which -a ruby
```
if we see something like this as output 
```text
/usr/bin/ruby
```
that means we already have ruby installed in our machine.

As the system Ruby is old, and it canâ€™t be updated we will not use the ruby that is already installed , instead we will set up latest version of ruby and then work with it.


we can set up ruby in a lot of different ways but my recommendation is to use a ruby version manager tool like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Also with `rbenv` we can switch between multiple Ruby versions on the same machine if needed.

So, lets setup `rbenv` and for that we need to run the below three commands

```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
vi ~/.zshrc 
eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```
Now let's understand what these command does. <br>
- This command `brew install rbenv ruby-build` installs the `rbenv` into our local machine and we are using `Homebrew`
- The next two commands ensure that `rbenv` is properly configured every time we start a new `zsh` session.So, when we run this command `vi ~/.zshrc`, we are opening the configuration file of `zsh` with `vim` and after that we need to add this line `eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)` to the `.zshrc` file.

If you are using `bash` then the commands looks like below
```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
vi ~/.bashrc
eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```
<br>
Now let's install Ruby. And for that we need to run these commands

```bash
rbenv install -l
rbenv install 3.2.2 --verbose
```
Now let's understand what these command does. <br>
- `rbenv install -l` shows all the latest stable ruby version, and we can choose what we want to install. At the time of writing this article we have ruby version : `3.2.2` and we are going to install ruby with the second command `rbenv install 3.2.2 --verbose`

When we install Ruby , `Ruby Gems` also gets installed. `Ruby Gems` or `gem` is a command-line tool for installing different packages or libraries that can be used in Ruby applications.
<br>

Now its time to install `bundler` and `jekyll`. These are two ruby gems or libraries that we are going to use for our static site.

```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
```

Let's verify that all the dependency are installed.
```bash
gem env home
which -a gem
which -a ruby
```
when the first command `gem env home` is run then, we should see something as output
```bash
/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/.rbenv/versions/3.2.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.2.0
```

And that means we have ruby setup in our local machine.
<br>
we can also verify even further with the last 2 commands

For this command `which -a gem`, the output should be

```bash
/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/.rbenv/shims/gem
```

For this command `which -a ruby`, the output should be

```bash
/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/.rbenv/shims/ruby
```



And that's it , so now we have all the component we need to continue building our static site.
